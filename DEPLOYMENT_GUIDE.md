## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Automated Health Check

```bash
# Test support page exists
curl -I https://watch-party.brahim-elhouss.me/support
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

# Test favicon exists
curl -I https://watch-party.brahim-elhouss.me/favicon.ico
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

# Test security headers
curl -I https://watch-party.brahim-elhouss.me/ | grep -i "content-security-policy"
# Expected: content-security-policy header present
```
