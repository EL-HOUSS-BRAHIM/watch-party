## ⚠️ NEW ISSUE DISCOVERED

### Authentication/Session Issue
- **Severity:** High
- **Location:** Login flow
- **Credentials Tested:** `admin@watchparty.local` / `admin123!`

#### Observed Behavior:
1. Login form at `/auth/login` loads correctly ✅
2. User enters credentials and clicks "Sign in"
3. POST request to `https://be-watch-party.brahim-elhouss.me/api/auth/login` returns **200 OK** ✅
4. Browser attempts to redirect to `/dashboard`
5. GET request to `/api/auth/session` returns **200 OK** ✅
6. **BUT:** User is redirected back to `/auth/login?redirect=%2Fdashboard` ❌
7. No session appears to persist

#### Network Activity (From Playwright):
```
[POST] https://be-watch-party.brahim-elhouss.me/api/auth/login => [200] ✅
[GET] https://watch-party.brahim-elhouss.me/dashboard => [200] ✅
[GET] https://watch-party.brahim-elhouss.me/api/auth/session => [200] ✅
[GET] https://watch-party.brahim-elhouss.me/auth/login?redirect=%2Fdashboard => [200] ❌
```

#### Diagnosis:
- **Login API works** - Returns 200 OK
- **Session API works** - Returns 200 OK
- **Problem:** Session token/cookie may not be persisting across requests
- **Likely Causes:**
  1. Cookie SameSite attribute issue
  2. Cookie domain mismatch (frontend vs backend domains)
  3. HttpOnly cookie not being sent from backend
  4. CORS credentials not being included
  5. Session middleware not detecting valid session

#### Recommended Investigation:
1. Check backend response headers for Set-Cookie
2. Verify cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite, Domain)
3. Check if cookies are being saved in browser
4. Verify CORS configuration includes `credentials: 'include'`
5. Check session validation logic in middleware

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Fix Authentication Session Persistence**
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Impact: Users cannot log in despite correct credentials
   - Action: Review backend cookie configuration and session management
   - Files to check:
     - Backend API response headers (Set-Cookie)
     - Frontend API client (credentials configuration)
     - Session middleware validation logic

### Optional Improvements
2. Add automated E2E tests for login flow
3. Add session timeout handling with user feedback
4. Implement "Remember me" functionality
5. Add loading states during login
