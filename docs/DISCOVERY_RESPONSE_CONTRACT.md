# Discovery Response Contract

The discovery experiences on the Watch Party dashboard ("Trending", "Recommendations", future curated lists) should all follow a consistent data contract so client features can reuse the same plumbing without bespoke fallbacks.

## Backend Response Shape

Discovery endpoints continue to return a `StandardResponse` envelope:

```jsonc
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Trending parties retrieved successfully",
  "data": [/* WatchParty */],
  "meta": {
    "generated_at": "2024-03-15T12:30:00Z",
    "results": 5
  }
}
```

Key guidelines:

- The curated collection itself lives in the `data` key of the envelope as a plain array of `WatchParty` objects.
- Use the optional `meta` object for supplemental information (timestamps, scoring method, result counts, etc.).
- Avoid mixing paginated and non-paginated schemasâ€”discovery surfaces return curated arrays, not `results` collections.

## Frontend Client Expectations

`frontend/lib/api-client.ts` unwraps the envelope for discovery helpers and returns plain arrays:

```ts
const parties = await partiesApi.getTrending() // => WatchParty[]
```

Consumers can rely on:

- `partiesApi.getTrending()` resolving to a `WatchParty[]` (empty array when nothing is trending).
- `partiesApi.getRecommendations()` resolving to a `WatchParty[]`.
- Any future discovery helper following the same pattern: the client unwraps the `StandardResponse` and exposes the array directly.

If additional metadata is required, extend the helper to return an object such as `{ parties, meta }`, reading the `meta` property supplied by the backend while maintaining the `StandardResponse` envelope at the transport layer.

## UI Handling

The dashboard now displays an informational message when curated lists return no items (e.g. no trending parties). Future discovery views should provide similar user feedback rather than falling back to unrelated lists.
