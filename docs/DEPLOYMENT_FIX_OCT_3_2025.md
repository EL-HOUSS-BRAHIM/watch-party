# Deployment Fix Summary - October 3, 2025

## Issue Identified
The deployment workflow #986 failed during the frontend build step with syntax errors.

## Root Cause
Two marketing component files were missing essential imports for the Card UI components:

1. **`frontend/components/marketing/feature-grid.tsx`**
   - Missing imports: `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardDescription`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`
   
2. **`frontend/components/marketing/testimonial-grid.tsx`**
   - Missing imports: `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardDescription`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`

## Error Details
```
Error: x Expected '</', got 'jsx text (
  |         )'
```

The Next.js build process failed because these components were using Card-related JSX elements without importing them from the UI library.

## Solution Applied
Added the missing import statement to both files:

```typescript
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
```

## Changes Made
- **File**: `frontend/components/marketing/feature-grid.tsx`
  - Added Card component imports

- **File**: `frontend/components/marketing/testimonial-grid.tsx`
  - Added Card component imports

## Deployment Status
- **Failed Run**: #986 (commit: ed710563)
- **Fix Commit**: b679a0c1 - "Fix missing Card component imports in marketing components"
- **New Run**: #987 (currently in progress)

## Verification
- Linting passed with only minor warnings about unused variables (not blocking)
- No syntax errors detected in the codebase
- Changes pushed to master branch
- New deployment workflow triggered automatically

## Next Steps
Monitor workflow run #987 to confirm successful deployment.
