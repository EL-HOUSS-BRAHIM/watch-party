# Footer Navigation Links Cleanup

## Overview
Removed duplicate links and reorganized the footer navigation for better clarity and user experience.

## Problems Identified

### 1. Duplicate "Support" Link
- Appeared in both "Company" section and "Resources" section
- Caused confusion and redundancy

### 2. Incorrect "About" Link
- Linked to `/#testimonials` (testimonials section on home page)
- Should link to the dedicated `/about` page

### 3. Misleading "Dashboard" Link
- Linked to `/auth/login` instead of `/dashboard`
- Users expect "Dashboard" to go to the dashboard, not login page

### 4. Duplicate "Pricing" Opportunity
- Pricing is important enough to be in Product section
- Was only in Resources section

## Changes Made

### Before
```tsx
{
  title: "Product",
  items: [
    { label: "Features", href: "/#features" },
    { label: "Dashboard", href: "/auth/login" },  // Wrong destination
    { label: "Mobile", href: "/#experience" }
  ]
},
{
  title: "Company",
  items: [
    { label: "About", href: "/#testimonials" },  // Wrong destination
    { label: "Community", href: "/join" },
    { label: "Support", href: "/support" }  // DUPLICATE
  ]
},
{
  title: "Resources",
  items: [
    { label: "Pricing", href: "/pricing" },
    { label: "Support", href: "/support" },  // DUPLICATE
    { label: "GitHub", href: "https://github.com/..." }
  ]
}
```

### After
```tsx
{
  title: "Product",
  items: [
    { label: "Features", href: "/#features" },
    { label: "Pricing", href: "/pricing" },      // ✅ Moved from Resources
    { label: "Dashboard", href: "/dashboard" }   // ✅ Fixed destination
  ]
},
{
  title: "Company",
  items: [
    { label: "About", href: "/about" },          // ✅ Fixed destination
    { label: "Support", href: "/support" },      // ✅ Kept here (removed from Resources)
    { label: "Community", href: "/join" }
  ]
},
{
  title: "Resources",
  items: [
    { label: "Guides", href: "/guides/watch-night" },  // ✅ New useful link
    { label: "GitHub", href: "https://github.com/..." },
    { label: "Get Started", href: "/auth/register" }   // ✅ Clear CTA
  ]
}
```

## Improvements

- ✅ **Dashboard**: Now correctly links to `/dashboard`
