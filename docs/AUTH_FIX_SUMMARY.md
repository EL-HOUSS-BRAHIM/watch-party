# Authentication Fix - Summary

**Issue Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Severity:** Critical (users cannot log in)  
**Status:** Fixed ‚úÖ

---

## Problem Description

Users were unable to log in to the WatchParty website. After entering valid credentials:
1. Login API returned 200 OK ‚úÖ
2. User was redirected to dashboard
3. Session validation failed ‚ùå
4. User was immediately redirected back to login page

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **two related problems**:

### 1. API Routes Removed (October 12, 2025)

All Next.js API routes were removed in a "simplification" effort (documented in `API_ROUTES_REMOVAL.md`). This meant:
- Frontend made direct CORS requests to Django backend
- Backend returned tokens in JSON response
- Tokens were exposed to client JavaScript (security vulnerability!)
- No HTTP-only cookies were set on the frontend domain

### 2. Nginx Configuration

The nginx configuration routed **all** `/api/` requests directly to the Django backend:

```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://backend;  # This caught /api/auth/login too!
}
```

This bypassed any potential cookie management on the frontend.

---

## The Fix

We implemented a **hybrid approach** that balances security and simplicity:

### 1. Re-added Minimal Auth API Routes

Created 4 new Next.js API routes **only for authentication**:
- `/api/auth/login` - Proxies to backend, sets HTTP-only cookies
- `/api/auth/logout` - Proxies to backend, clears cookies
- `/api/auth/session` - Validates session from cookies
- `/api/auth/refresh` - Refreshes access token in cookies

**Why this is necessary:**
- HTTP-only cookies can only be set by server-side code
- Tokens must never be exposed to client JavaScript (XSS protection)
- Cookies must be set on the frontend domain for proper session management

### 2. Updated Nginx Configuration

Added a **more specific** location block for auth endpoints:

```nginx
# Auth routes to frontend (for cookie management) - MUST come first!
location /api/auth/ {
    proxy_pass http://frontend;
}

# All other API routes to backend
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://backend;
}
```

Nginx matches locations by **longest prefix**, so `/api/auth/` (14 chars) is matched before `/api/` (5 chars).

### 3. Updated Frontend Libraries

- `lib/api-client.ts`: Routes auth endpoints through frontend API, all others direct to backend
- `lib/auth.ts`: Uses `/api/auth/session` endpoint for session validation

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (Broken)

```
Browser
  ‚Üì
  POST /api/auth/login
  ‚Üì
  Nginx ‚Üí Backend (Django) [direct]
  ‚Üì
  Backend returns {access_token, refresh_token, user}
  ‚Üì
  Browser receives tokens in JSON [INSECURE!]
  ‚Üì
  No cookies set ‚ùå
  ‚Üì
  Session validation fails
  ‚Üì
  Redirect to login
```

### After (Fixed)

```
Browser
  ‚Üì
  POST /api/auth/login
  ‚Üì
  Nginx ‚Üí Frontend (Next.js API route)
  ‚Üì
  Next.js ‚Üí Backend (Django)
  ‚Üì
  Backend returns {access_token, refresh_token, user}
  ‚Üì
  Next.js sets HTTP-only cookies ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
  Next.js returns {success: true, user: {...}} [NO TOKENS]
  ‚Üì
  Browser receives response + cookies
  ‚Üì
  Session validation works ‚úÖ
```

## Security Improvements

‚úÖ **HTTP-only Cookies**: Tokens cannot be accessed by JavaScript  
‚úÖ **No Token Exposure**: Tokens never appear in JSON responses  
‚úÖ **SameSite Protection**: Cookies have `SameSite=Lax` to prevent CSRF  
‚úÖ **Secure Flag**: Cookies require HTTPS in production  
‚úÖ **Proper Domain Scoping**: Cookies set on correct frontend domain

## Files Changed

### Created (4 files)
- `frontend/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `frontend/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`
- `frontend/app/api/auth/session/route.ts`
- `frontend/app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts`

### Modified (3 files)
- `frontend/lib/api-client.ts` - Routes auth endpoints to frontend API
- `frontend/lib/auth.ts` - Uses session endpoint for validation
- `nginx/conf.d/default.conf` - Routes auth endpoints to frontend

### Documentation (3 files)
- `docs/AUTH_FIX_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment instructions
- `docs/AUTH_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file
- `scripts/test-auth-flow.sh` - Automated testing script

---

## Testing

Run the automated test script after deployment:

```bash
cd /path/to/watch-party
./scripts/test-auth-flow.sh
```

This will test:
1. Login (checks cookies are set, tokens not exposed)
2. Session validation (checks cookies work)
3. Dashboard access (checks no redirect to login)
4. Logout (checks session is cleared)

---

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Pull latest code from repository
- [ ] Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
- [ ] Build frontend: `npm run build`
- [ ] Update nginx config: Copy `nginx/conf.d/default.conf` to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`
- [ ] Test nginx config: `sudo nginx -t`
- [ ] Reload nginx: `sudo nginx -s reload`
- [ ] Restart frontend: `pm2 restart watchparty-frontend`
- [ ] Run test script: `./scripts/test-auth-flow.sh`
- [ ] Verify in browser: Try logging in

## Why Not Keep Direct Backend Calls?

Direct backend calls were attempted but **don't work** for authentication because:

1. **Cookie Domain Mismatch**
   - Backend: `be-watch-party.brahim-elhouss.me`
   - Frontend: `watch-party.brahim-elhouss.me`
   - Cookies set by backend on its domain won't be sent by frontend

2. **CORS Credentials**
   - Setting cookies cross-origin is restricted by browsers
   - Even with `credentials: 'include'`, cookie acceptance is limited

3. **Security**
   - Direct calls would require backend to return tokens in JSON
   - This exposes tokens to JavaScript (XSS vulnerability)
   - HTTP-only cookies are the secure standard

---

## Future Considerations

### What We Kept Simple
- All non-auth endpoints still call backend directly
- No unnecessary proxy layer for most API calls
- Minimal code surface area for auth

### What We Secured
- Authentication flow uses server-side proxy
- Tokens in HTTP-only cookies
- No token exposure to client code

This is the **best of both worlds**: simplicity for most APIs, security for authentication.
