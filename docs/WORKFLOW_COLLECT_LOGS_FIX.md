# ðŸ”§ Collect Service Logs Workflow Fix

## Problem Description

The "Collect service logs" workflow was failing with errors because it was trying to run Docker Compose commands locally on the GitHub Actions runner, but the actual services are running on the remote Lightsail server.

### Issues Found

1. **Wrong Execution Context**: The workflow was trying to run `docker compose` commands directly on the GitHub Actions runner instead of connecting to the remote server
2. **No Services Running**: The GitHub Actions runner doesn't have any Docker containers running, causing the workflow to fail immediately
3. **Missing SSH Connection**: Unlike the `deploy.yml` and `destroy.yml` workflows, this workflow wasn't connecting to the remote server via SSH

## Solution Implemented

The workflow has been completely rewritten to:

### 1. Connect to Remote Server via SSH
- Uses the same `appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3` action as other workflows
- Connects to the Lightsail server using the stored secrets:
  - `LIGHTSAIL_HOST`: The server hostname/IP
  - `LIGHTSAIL_SSH_KEY`: The SSH private key for authentication
  - `deploy` user: The deployment user on the server

### 2. Find Application Directory
- Automatically detects the application directory location:
  - First tries `/srv/watch-party` (standard location)
  - Falls back to `$HOME/watch-party` (alternative location)
  - Exits with clear error if not found

### 3. Support Both Docker Compose Variants
- Checks for `docker-compose` (older standalone version)
- Falls back to `docker compose` (newer Docker plugin version)
- Ensures compatibility regardless of server setup

### 4. Collect Comprehensive Logs
The workflow now collects:
- **Service logs**: Logs from all services (backend, frontend, nginx, celery-worker, celery-beat, db)
  - Includes timestamps for easier debugging
  - Limits to last 1000 lines per service to avoid huge files
  - Handles both running and stopped services
- **Container status**: Output of `docker-compose ps` showing all container states
- **System status**: Output of `docker ps -a` showing all Docker containers
- **Summary file**: Includes:
  - Collection timestamp
  - Server hostname
  - Application directory path
  - List of all services and running services
  - Docker and Docker Compose versions

### 5. Save Logs to Repository
- Saves logs directly to the `logs/` directory in the project on the server
- Downloads the entire logs directory to the local repository
- Commits and pushes the logs back to the repository
- Replaces existing logs on each run (no timestamped archives)

## Usage

### To Collect Logs:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Select "Collect service logs" from the workflow list
4. Click "Run workflow" button
5. Wait for the workflow to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
6. Check the `logs/` directory in the repository - it will be automatically updated with the latest logs

### What You'll Get:

The `logs/` directory in your repository will contain:

```
logs/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend.log              # Backend service logs
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend.log             # Frontend service logs
â”œâ”€â”€ nginx.log                # Nginx service logs
â”œâ”€â”€ celery-worker.log        # Celery worker logs
â”œâ”€â”€ celery-beat.log          # Celery beat scheduler logs
â”œâ”€â”€ db.log                   # PostgreSQL database logs
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose-ps.txt    # Container status from docker-compose
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-ps-all.txt        # All Docker containers status
â””â”€â”€ summary.txt              # Summary with system information
```

**Note**: Each run replaces the previous logs, so the directory always contains the most recent logs.

## Error Handling

The workflow includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Application directory not found**: Clear error message showing which paths were checked
- **Docker Compose not available**: Detects and reports if Docker Compose is not installed
- **No services found**: Reports if docker-compose.yml is missing or no services are defined
- **Service log collection failure**: Continues collecting other logs even if one service fails
- **Download failure**: Reports clear error if unable to download logs from server

## Benefits

âœ… **Works correctly**: Connects to the actual server where services are running
âœ… **Comprehensive**: Collects logs from all services in one go
âœ… **Always up-to-date**: Each run replaces old logs with fresh ones
âœ… **Easy access**: Logs are stored in the repository's `logs/` directory
âœ… **Resilient**: Handles errors gracefully and continues where possible
âœ… **Timestamped**: Summary file includes collection timestamp for tracking
âœ… **Informative**: Includes system status and version information

## Technical Details

### Workflow File
- Location: `.github/workflows/collect-service-logs.yml`
- Trigger: Manual (`workflow_dispatch`)
- Runs on: `ubuntu-latest`

### Steps:
1. **Checkout repository**: Gets the workflow code
2. **Collect logs from server**: Connects via SSH and collects logs to `logs/` directory on server
3. **Download logs from server**: Uses SCP to download the logs directory
4. **Commit and push logs**: Commits the updated logs back to the repository

### Dependencies:
- SSH access to Lightsail server
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on server
- Running services (or at least defined in docker-compose.yml)
- Sufficient disk space in the project's `logs/` directory

## Testing

The workflow has been tested to handle:
- âœ… Services running normally
- âœ… Some services stopped or failed
- âœ… Both docker-compose and docker compose commands
- âœ… Different application directory locations
- âœ… Large log files (limited to 1000 lines per service)

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future versions:
- Add option to specify which services to collect logs from
- Add option to specify number of log lines to collect
- Include system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- Add option to collect logs from specific time range
- Support for streaming logs in real-time
- Add log rotation to keep historical snapshots
