# Public Pages Design Consistency Fix

## Overview
Updated the pricing and about pages to match the home page's light, modern design system with consistent brand colors and styling.

## Problem
The pricing and about pages had a dark, purple-tinted design that didn't match the home page's light, clean aesthetic with brand colors (cyan, magenta, orange, purple, navy).

## Pages Updated

- ✅ Right card (Core Stats): Gradient background with colored stat boxes

## Design System Applied

### Color Palette

### Components
- **Badges**: Rounded-full with colored borders and backgrounds

### Spacing
- Consistent use of `space-y-20` for major sections

- Proper padding with responsive breakpoints

## Benefits
