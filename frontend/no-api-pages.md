# Frontend routes without API requests

This audit covers every Next.js page, layout, and loading state under `frontend/app`. Pages marked with âœ… now use backend APIs, while others remain static with mock data.

## Marketing routes (`app/(public)` and root) - STATIC CONTENT
- `/` â€“ `app/page.tsx` renders marketing sections that only read static testimonial and feature data from `@/lib/data/home` and local constants. No data fetching hooks or `fetch` calls are present.
- `/about` â€“ `app/(public)/about/page.tsx` relies on inline arrays for the company timeline and design principles.
- `/pricing` â€“ `app/(public)/pricing/page.tsx` defines the pricing plans and FAQ copy in local constants.
- `/guides/watch-night` â€“ `app/(public)/guides/watch-night/page.tsx` sources the guide steps and signature rituals from in-file arrays.

Shared marketing chrome (`app/layout.tsx`, `components/layout/site-header.tsx`, `components/layout/site-footer.tsx`, and `components/providers.tsx`) also avoids API calls. Navigation links and hero copy are statically defined.

The dashboard route group layout (`app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` and `components/dashboard/dashboard-layout.tsx`) determines active navigation with `usePathname` but does not perform any data fetching.

## Global loading state
- `app/loading.tsx` renders a branded loading screen without performing network activity.

## API routes for reference
The only API route present is `app/api/health/route.ts`, which returns a static JSON payload. No page or component invokes it during render.

- âœ… **API client utility** created at `lib/api-client.ts`
- âœ… **Graceful fallback** to mock data when API unavailable
- âœ… **Error notifications** inform users when demo data is being used
- ðŸ“Œ **Marketing pages** remain static (appropriate for marketing content)
- ðŸ“Œ **Some UI sections** keep mock data as placeholders for future features
